          Event booking/reservation systems are often complex, monolithic
          platforms that are hard to use and harder to manage. Our mission is to
          create a simple, open source, and easy-to-use event ticketing system
          for events that don't require seating arrangements. We strive to
          create a frictionless experience for your attendees, boosting signup
          numbers and making sure your attendees arrive the day of.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-16">why reservations?</h2>
        <p className="my-4 ">
          When it comes to managing or creating reservation systems for a
          ticketed event, traditional solutions can be cumbersome and
          challenging to use. Our platform, reservations, offers a simple, OSS,
          easy-to-use ticketing system for events that allows users to reserve
          their seats ahead of time. Our registration process lets users sign up
          online using their email and receive a QR code that serves as their
          ticket, which an event organizer can scan to confirm their
          reservation. Simplify your reservation management and provide your
          customers with a seamless booking experience today! Contact quick007

        <p className="mt-4 ">
          Event booking/reservation systems are often complex, monolithic platforms that are
          hard to use and harder to manage. Our mission is to create a simple
          and easy-to-use event ticketing system for events that don't require seating
          arrangements. We strive to create a frictionless experience for your
          attendees, boosting signup numbers and making sure your attendees
          arrive the day of.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-16">Why reservations?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 ">
          When it comes to managing or creating reservation systems for a
          ticketed event, traditional solutions can be cumbersome and
          challenging to use. Our platform, reservations, offers a simple,
          easy-to-use ticketing system for events that allows users to reserve
          their seats ahead of time. Our registration process lets users sign up
          online using their email and receive a QR code that serves as their
          ticket, which an event organizer can scan to confirm their
          reservation. Simplify your reservation management and provide your
          customers with a seamless booking experience today!
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-16">Have reservations?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 ">
          Our platform has been built from the ground up with usability in mind.
          Each feature has been precision-engineered to work well on all
          devices, and looks esspecilly great on mobile. The user-friendly
          interface simplifies the reservation process, ensuring a seamless
          booking experience for both you and your attendees. So, put aside your
          reservations and give reservations a try!
